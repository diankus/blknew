    <p>Squamous cell carcinomas detected at an early stage and removed promptly are almost always curable and cause minimal damage. However, left untreated, they may grow to the point of being very difficult to treat. Cscc could be in situ (e.g., bowen’s disease) or an invasive form. During stage 0, the cancer hasn’t spread beyond the epidermis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis.</p>
